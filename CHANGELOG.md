# Changelog

All notable changes to Raven Nest MCP are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (pre-1.0:
minor versions may carry feature additions and refinements).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

First tagged release. 22 security tools plus the Metasploit Framework across 43
MCP endpoints. Highlights accumulated since the initial 0.1.0 state:

### Added
- **Secret scanning** — `run_gitleaks` (working-tree and git-history modes) and
  `run_trufflehog` (filesystem, optional live verification, off by default).
  Scan paths are confined via `validate_file_path`; secret values are never
  echoed in parsed output or persisted findings. trufflehog never passes
  `--trust-local-git-config` (CVE-2025-41390).
- **Recon tools** — `run_httpx`, `run_dnsx`, `run_katana`.
- **Engagement scope** — optional `[scope]` authorization allowlist
  (CIDRs/domains, deny-wins, loopback-aware); off by default.
- **Engagements** — `set_engagement` / `list_engagements`; each scopes its own
  findings and reports directory.
- **Audit logging** — every tool execution appended to `{output_dir}/audit.log`
  (JSON lines, redacted args, 0600, size-rotated).
- **Auto-extracted findings** from eight scanners (nuclei, nikto, dalfox, nmap,
  sqlmap, testssl, gitleaks, trufflehog), opt-in via `auto_save_findings`,
  deduplicated and tagged `AutoExtracted`.
- **Scan↔finding linking** — `scan_id` on findings + `list_findings_by_scan`.
- **Report formats** — JSON, SARIF 2.1.0, and HTML in addition to Markdown
  (`generate_report` `format` parameter).
- **Structured tool output** (`structured_content`) on finding/scan/report tools.
- **NetExec** (`run_netexec`) — gated, read-only credentialed enumeration; off
  by default.
- **Resource controls** — `scan_retention_secs` (scan registry TTL/eviction),
  `max_concurrent_execs` (synchronous execution cap), and `min_exec_gap_ms`
  (proactive per-launch cooldown).

### Changed
- Upgraded `rmcp` 1.1 → 1.7.
- `http_request` now enforces the engagement scope.
- `run_ffuf` pins an explicit `-mc` default
  (`200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405,500`) instead of relying on ffuf's
  version-specific default, which had narrowed to 2XX and hid redirects/401/403.

### Fixed
- `http_request` no longer bypasses scope/target validation.
- Bumped `quinn-proto` to patch RUSTSEC-2026-0185.

### Security
- Engagement scope allowlist, audit logging, proactive launch cooldown, and
  redaction of secret values from secret-scanner findings.

## [0.1.0] - initial

Initial (untagged) MCP server: core safety pipeline (allowlist, target
validation, preset arguments, output sanitisation, quality assessment), the
initial scanner set, background scan management, file-per-finding storage, and
Markdown report generation.
